# Weblint Chrome Extension

Weblint cleans the web's cruft.

Check it out at [weblint.io](http://www.weblint.io)

## What is this?

A chrome extension that injects custom CSS by domain from a
[core rule set](https://github.com/weblintio/core-rules).

## What does it do?

Provide a minimalist web experience across a number of popular domains.

## How do I get some?

[Install it for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/weblint/knmacabibfghdkhnpacfkkeffleijdpd)

## Why?

Lot of reasons!

The web is a magical place of openness just waiting to be
hacked. No, not _that_ kind of hacking, the good kind! The kind where you tinker
and make changes in the hopes of improving and innovating on the status quo.

In this case, Weblint was born out of the frustration of having to look at and
navigate around countless UI elements that are only used <1% of the time.
